## üëã Hello, Digital World!

Welcome to my GitHub!
I'm **aphinqq**, a passionate software developer with a knack for solving my own real-world problems through code and automation.

## üåü My Smaller Projects
Projects I've only worked on for a few hours or days, solving irritating problems or just for fun.
######
I'm not able to list all of my projects here, but here are a few that I think are worth mentioning:

### üì∑ Reddit Video Maker
*Automating the creation of viral 60s short form content*
- Built a Python application that will take a Reddit thread, scrape data, and create multiple 60s videos
- Used Streamlabs TTS and OpenAI Whisper to generate voice-overs and automatic subtitles
- [Make some videos](https://github.com/aphcore/Python-Video-Generator)

### ü§ñ AlchemyBot
*Automating the most tedius action in Hypixel Skyblock*
- A few years ago, I built a bot in a third-party scripting language to automate the tedious process of brewing potions in Hypixel Skyblock
- Improved my understanding of data storage and optimization
- [Brew some potions](https://github.com/aphcore/alchemybot)

### üåç Cloudflare Turnstile Bypass
*A quick Proof of Concept*
- Implemented a headless browser with Puppeteer stealth to obtain numerous Cloudflare Turnstile tokens
- Deobfuscated and overwrote Realmz.io's websocket method to intercept tokens and potentially redirect them to a cloud server for future usage
- [Get some tokens](https://github.com/aphcore/Cloudflare-Turnstile-Bypass)
