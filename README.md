## üëã Hello, Digital World!

Welcome to my GitHub!
I'm **aphinqq**, a passionate software developer with a knack for solving my own real-world problems through code and automation.

## üåü My Smaller Projects
Projects I've only worked on for a few hours or days, solving irritating problems or just for fun.
######
I'm not able to list all of my projects here, but here are a few that I think are worth mentioning:

### üåç Cloudflare Turnstile Bypass
*A quick Proof of Concept for the Realmz.io development team*
- Implemented a headless browser with Puppeteer stealth to obtain numerous Cloudflare Turnstile tokens per minute
- Deobfuscated and overwrote Realmz.io's websocket method to intercept tokens and potentially redirect them to a cloud server for future usage
- [Get some tokens](https://github.com/aphcore/Cloudflare-Turnstile-Bypass)

### üì∑ Reddit Video Maker
*Automating the creation of viral 60s short form content*
- Built a Python application to take a Reddit thread, scrape data, and create multiple 60s videos
- Used Streamlabs TTS and OpenAI Whisper to generate voice-overs and automatic subtitles
- [Make some videos](https://github.com/aphcore/Python-Video-Generator)

### üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Network Level Adblocker
*When playing a mobile game with pop-up ads doesn't let you play with network disabled*
- Built a NodeJS proxy to filter ads and trackers.
- Used specifically for blocking ads on mobile games that prevented playing with network disabled.
- Play with network enabled while blocking the domains of pop-up ads!
- [Block some ads](https://github.com/aphcore/Network-Level-Adblock)

### ü§ñ AlchemyBot
*Automating the most tedious action in Hypixel Skyblock*
- A few years ago, I built a bot in a third party scripting language to automate the tedious process of brewing potions in Hypixel Skyblock
- Improved my understanding of data storage and optimization
- [Brew some potions](https://github.com/aphcore/alchemybot)
